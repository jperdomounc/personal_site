      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <time>Feb 22, 2026</time>

      <p>Hi, I'm writing this the same day the site is deployed. I guess this is technically the first site I've officially deployed a site. 
        I wrote a few personal sites back in the day (2018), but they're lost to time.</p>
      <p>Well about me, my name is Juan Perdomo. I really enjoy programming and Computer Science ever since playing Minecraft for the first time (though Microsoft is doing a bad job with it). 
        I'm a CS student at UNC Chapel Hill if you didn't know by now. In my free time I like to workout; I was inspired originally by my dad who was into the gold's gym arnold era. I also like to read philosophy and try to understand it,
         Plato is by far my favorite just in terms of his writing style and every topic he covers. I have a husky named Bruce who is about 3 years old (idk his birthday ngl) whom I raised since he was a puppy and I love him. Since I got into CS because of video games, I of course dabble in graphics programming
         I'm getting pretty good at OpenGL and I'll post some screenshots of my project soon. I really enjoy C++ more so than Java or JS, the control it gives you is just really nice, although dealing with external libraries almost made me quit C++ altogether.
         CMake and make do make things pretty nice at times. I quite enjoy Unix operating systems like Mac and Linux. It is of course miles better than Windows and doesn't inject copilot into your notepad to get you hacked. The security team at Microsoft is probably looking to find another job asap.

        I love programming and I love getting better at it. I am constantly finding ways to improve. I love to read textbooks on CS topics I've found intersting a few I've read are Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, a bit of C++ Concurrency in Action, and TCP/IP Illustrated.
        I am currently trying to become cracked at Vim motions and they really do make programming so much better. C++ is very complex as well and have been working through some trouble areas with some textbooks as well.

        My favorite show is One Punch Man and I've been revisiting season 1 after the season 3 fiasco and have just been relishing every frame of season 1.
        I honestly just find the visuals, music, and animation so good and it's great. My favorite character is probably Genos. I also am rewatching Jujutsu Kaisen and Jojo's in preparation for the new seasons.
