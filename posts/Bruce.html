      <h1>My Dog Bruce</h1>
      <time>Feb 25, 2026</time>

      <p>I wanted to talk about how my beloved dog got his name. I had this name in mind prior to even knowing my dog was up for adoption.
        I've linked the video below that gave me the name Bruce. But if you don't want to watch it, it's a very touching story of a dude who wanted to go on an adventure, so he joined the shaolin temple.
        There was a short side story of a dog named Bruce that would hang out around the monks while they practiced kung fu. He mentioned he was a very friendly and sweet dog, but he disappeared one day and never came back. They suspected
        he was hit by a car since he liked to roam the streets. I remember my 8th grade self being very touched by the story and wanted to name my dog Bruce because it's a cool sounding name and to honor the story of the dog that I found very impactful at the time.
    
      </p>
      <p>On a side note, my family in Honduras recently got a new puppy and they also named him Bruce. Presumably after my own dog Bruce. So the original Chinese Bruce and his legacy lives on in a rural mountain town in Honduras. Crazy connection, if you ever needed some connection between Henan, China and Belen-Lempira, Honduras. There you go.</p>
